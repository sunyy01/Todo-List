# My Personal Project

## Project Proposal

###Questions:

- What will the application do?
- item Who will use it?
- Why is this project of interest to you?

###Answer:
The to-do list application, as its name described, will provide a list of to-do things the customer entered. 
The application includes several features for costumer to mark and organize the listing. For example:
- Costumer can add tasks to to-do list and can edit the name and deadline by searching the task name
- Costumer can change the status of added tasks, such as marked as "_completed_";
- Costumer can remove any tasks on the list by searching the task name;
- If the customer only want to track undone things , then the application only shows those marked as "_outstanding_";
- Costumer can check complete tasks and incomplete tasks and see how many tasks remains;
- Other possible features can be: show listings in **alphabetical** oder or **chronological** order.

The application should be popular among various population:
1. **Students**: using the application to make to-do list for assignments, projects and exam.


2. **Workers**: using the application to make to-do list for tasks, work, meetings, etc.


3. **Mothers**: using the application to make a shopping list

The project is really useful for all people. And one can expand the features in various ways to make de application
even more interesting and comprehensive for different uses. However, it might also be challenging to design the whole 
project to allow the application manage the list in customized methods.

##Phase4 :Task 3
Reflection:

If I had more time to work on the project, I might to the following refactoring to improve my design:

1. I have multiple different ActionListeners, and most of them have the same relationship with other class, and similar 
structure. I could create
a superclass to improve the management.

2. I create multiple buttons in the GuiMain class, and there are duplications on the coding, if possible, I
might create an abstract class for the buttons.
